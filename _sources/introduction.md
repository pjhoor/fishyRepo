# Introduction

Global warming is an ever increasing problem to the whole world. All of humanityâ€™s emissions are the cause for effects such as melting ice caps, extreme weather events, and loss of species. Solutions for this problem include switching to sustainable energy sources, such as solar-, wind- and hydropower. But is it true that countries with more sustainable energy production have fewer emissions?

This data story will explore whether or not sustainable energy has a positive effect on lessening the total emissions of a country. This analyzes it's contribution to fight climate change. Two datasets will be compared containing data about countries' emissions and sustainable energy, keeping in mind the country's area and other factors. The data used, dates back from the year 2000 to 2020.


Global warming has been a big problem for the whole world, but we have two different perspectives on whether or not sustainable energy is the best solution.

On one hand, sustainable energy is important to lower emissions and fight climate change. The different kinds of sustainable energy per country have a positive impact on the emissions (less emissions) of that country. It wins back renewable energy in a sustainable way so that there is less need to generate energy with non-renewable ways causing bad emissions. Sustainable energy could be a great solution to global warming.

On the other hand, while global warming is indeed a big problem in the world, sustainable energy might not be the solution. The sustainable energy per country can not keep up with the amount of emissions per country to have a positive effect. In other words, sustainable energy might not be the solution to global warming.


In short, this data story will explore the correlation between emissions and sustainable energy per country. To discover if sustainable energy really is the best solution to global warming.
