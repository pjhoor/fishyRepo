# Work Distribution

Our group worked as a team and helped each other out when things went wrong. We communicated through making calls, chatting and meeting at campus.
Generally we worked on many aspects together, but we highlighted the following distribution of the work below.

he was also in charge of handling all GitHub related issues and the general structure of the notebook. He also wrote the data preprocessing part.
