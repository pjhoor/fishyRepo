    "### Datasets used\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first used dataset provides an overview on different kinds of emissions per country from 2000 to 2020. It also splits the kind of emissions by direct and indirect emissions and shows the sources and types of emissions. This way many kinds of different emissions for all countries can be analyzed to see which countries have the most emissions and what kind of emissions these are. It contains 58765 records and 25 variables.\n",
    "- The dataset about total emissions per country during 2000-2020 can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justin2028/total-emissions-per-country-2000-2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset we used shows many kinds of sustainable energy of 176 countries from 2000 to 2020. It also contains information such as financial flows, access to electricity and a country's CO2 emissions. It shows the different kinds of electricity and energy per country per year to be able to analyze which countries have the most sustainable energy and which countries need to work on it. The dataset provides the capability to analyze renewable energy potential assessment and investment strategies based on regions. It contains 3649 records and 21 variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lastly, we started using a third dataset halfway through the project. This dataset contains the population of all countries for the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015, 2020 and 2022. This dataset provided the ability to visualize the emmissions per capita in all countries. It contains 234 records and 17 variables.\n",

    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "First of all, for the first two bar charts, we needed the total amount of CO2 emitted per country, for all years. To get this, we filtered our dataset \"Total Emissions Per Country (2000-2020)\" to only keep the relevant data. We specifically selected the CO2 emissions only, and we had to choose between the values: 'All sectors without LULUCF' and 'All sectors with LULUCF'. LULUCF stands for Land-Use Change and Forestry which includes the emissions that are released when cutting down forests, but also the emissions that are absorbed when planting forests. Which means that this LULUCF value can be negative. Eventually we settled on the data without LULUCF, because otherwise some countries would have negative CO2 emissions, which would be confusing to visualize.\n",
    "After that, we combined this data with the total surface area of each country from our \"Global Data on Sustainable Energy (2000-2020)\" dataset. Then we made new columns for each year, containing the relative emissions, which are the emissions divided by the country surface area (kilotonnes CO2/km^2).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For our world heat map, we needed to normalize these relative emissions to turn them into values from 0 to 1, we then used these normalized values to assign colors from green to yellow to red to each country in our heat map."

    "#### The variables used in the data story have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discrete / Categorical variables: `Element`, `Area`, `Item`, `Entity`\n",
    "- Discrete / Interval variables: `Year`\n",
    "- Continuous / Ratio variables: `20xx` (years 2000-2020), `Electricity from fossil fuels (TWh)`, `Electricity from nuclear (TWh)`, `Electricity from renewables (TWh)`,\n",

    "#### The meaning of the variables is the following:\n",
    "The variables we used from the first dataset (Total emissions per country during 2000-2020) were:\n",
    "- `Element` means the type of emissions. We use the element CO2 for emissions.\n",
    "- `Area` is a country or continent in the world.\n",
    "- `Item` is the source of the emissions.\n",
    "- `20xx` (years 2000-2020) is the amount of kilotones CO2 that was emitted in the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables we used from the second dataset (Global Data on Sustainable Energy (2000-2020)) were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Entity` means the name of the country or region, which is needed to get the data of countries and compare them.\n",
    "- `Year` is the year of the data 2000-2020, which is needed to analyze the data.\n",
    "- `Electricity from fossil fuels (TWh)` is the total electricity in TWh obtained from fossil fuels from a country.\n",
    "- `Electricity from nuclear (TWh)` is the total electricity in TWh obtained from nuclear sources from a country.\n",
    "- `Electricity from renewables (TWh)` is the total electricity in TWh obtained from renewable sources from a country.\n",
    "- `Land Area (Km2)` means the total area of the country or region in kmÂ², which we can use to fairly compare the sustainable energy between countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables we used from the third dataset (World Population Dataset) were:\n",
    "- `Country/Territory` the name of the country.\n",
    "- `19xx/20xx Population` (the population per country in the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015, 2020, 2022)."
