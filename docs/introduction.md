# Introduction

Global warming is an ever increasing problem to the whole world. All of humanityâ€™s emissions are the cause for effects such as melting ice caps, extreme weather events, and loss of species. Solutions for this problem include switching to sustainable energy sources, such as solar-, wind- and hydropower. But is it true that countries with more sustainable energy production have fewer emissions?

This data story will explore whether or not sustainable energy has a positive effect on lessening the total emissions of a country. This analyzes it's contribution to fight climate change. Two datasets will be compared containing data about countries' emissions and sustainable energy, keeping in mind the country's area and other factors. The data used, dates back from the year 2000 to 2020.


Global warming has been a big problem for the whole world, but we have two different perspectives on whether or not sustainable energy is the best solution.

On one hand, sustainable energy is important to lower emissions and fight climate change. The different kinds of sustainable energy per country affect the emissions in that country so that there are less emissions. It wins back renewable energy in a sustainable way so that there is less need to obtain energy causing bad emissions. So there will be a positive correlation between sustainable energy and lessening the emissions per country.

On the other hand, while global warming is indeed a big problem in the world, sustainable energy might not be the solution. The sustainable energy per country can not keep up with the amount of emissions per country to have a positive effect. There will not be a clear positive correlation between sustainable energy and fewer emissions per country.


In short, this data story will explore the correlation between emissions and sustainable energy per country.
